# Readwise Sync [BETA]

This is an **official** [Readwise](https://readwise.io) plugin for Obsidian.

This version is a super early one, and it's not a proper release - we want to test it with a small batch of beta testers.

If you have any feedback - please reach out at hello@readiwse.io

### Development

Create an `.env` file in the repo root with a `READWISE_SERVER_URL` variable there with a path to the local Readwise server
