# Readwise Official

![beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-beta-orange)

This is an official [Readwise](https://readwise.io) plugin for Obsidian maintained by Readwise team.

This version is a super early one, and it's not a proper release - we want to test it with a small batch of beta testers.

If you have any feedback - please reach out at [hello@readwise.io](mailto:hello@readwise.io)

## How this plugin works?

First and foremost it enables you to export all of your highlights from Readwise to Obsidian and keep them in sync afterwards (note that the sync is only one directional â€“ deleting a highlight/book file from Obsidian won't affect your readwise data).

### Configuration options
